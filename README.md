# Discord RPG Bot Project

Welcome to the Discord RPG Bot project! This README outlines the project's objectives and provides links to individual task tickets for development tracking.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop a Discord RPG bot that allows players to explore a dynamic world, engage in combat, manage inventories, and progress through quests, all within a Discord server.

## Task Management
