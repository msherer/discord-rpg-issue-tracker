# Task: Create Quest Framework

**Objective**: Develop a framework for managing quests and objectives.

## Subtasks

- [x] Define quest data structure (e.g., objectives, rewards).
- [x] Implement quest initiation and completion logic.
- [x] Develop commands for quest interaction:
  - [x] `!rpg quest [quest-name]`: Begin or resume a quest.
  - [x] `!rpg complete-quest`: Complete the current quest.

## Notes

- Quests should have clear goals and meaningful rewards.
- Allow players to track their progress and revisit incomplete quests.


### Implementation Tips:

  1.	Quest Assignment: Upon completing certain quests or reaching specific milestones, assign new quests to players automatically or through interactions with NPCs.
  2.	Quest Tracking: Allow players to check their active quests, progress, and remaining objectives via a command like !rpg quests.
  3.	Random Encounters: During exploration, introduce random encounters that can either be beneficial or challenging, adding unpredictability to the gameplay.
  4.	Quest Completion: Provide clear feedback when a quest is completed, including a summary of rewards, and automatically start related follow-up quests if prerequisites are met.
  5.	Reset Mechanisms: Ensure that daily and weekly quests reset appropriately and can be re-attempted by players after the reset period.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Players can start, progress, and complete quests.
- Quests offer appropriate rewards based on difficulty.
